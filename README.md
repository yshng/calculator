# calculator

This is a basic calculator exercise. 

This calculator requires two operands and an operator to perform a calculation. You may chain operators without hitting equals. Like the Google calculator, and unlike the macOS calculator, the equals button does not perform iterative calculations ("2 + = = = = = =" continues to display 2, rather than 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).
